# SoMPriest
A Shadow priest rotation primarily used for leveling and BGs. Also supports healing dungeons. I will be slowly adding more PvP logic, including engineering items, trinkets etc.

You can critique my code, as I am definitely still learning :)

For leveling, you must have you wand bound to Keybind 1.

To use spell queue system, macro your abilites like below:<br>
#showtooltip Mind Blast<br>
/run _G.QueueRogueCast("Mind Blast", "target")<br>
/cast Mind Blast
